```

- **`botropolisd`** owns the model.
  It scans once at start, then updates from inotify events and hook pushes.
  It serves snapshots and a subscription stream, and executes actions by shelling out to `claude`.
- **`botropolis-hook`** is installed into `~/.claude/settings.json` hooks by `botropolis install-hooks`.
  It forwards the hook's JSON to the socket with a short timeout and exits 0 no matter what,
  so a dead daemon never slows a session.
- **`botropolis`** is the client.
  `botropolis status` prints a table; `botropolis` with no arguments opens the city.

Layout (per the Go conventions in this workspace):

```
cmd/botropolis/         client entry point
cmd/botropolisd/        daemon entry point
cmd/botropolis-hook/    hook forwarder
pkg/app/                fx wiring: the botropolis CLI graph and the botropolisd lifecycle
pkg/cli/                cobra commands, one constructor per command, config loaded inside RunE
pkg/commands/           what the commands do (status table, hooks, session control), tested with fakes
pkg/config/             viper: flags, BOTROPOLIS_* env, ~/.config/botropolis/config.{toml,yaml,json}
pkg/city/               the map model: districts, buildings, camera, sticky layout, hover cards
pkg/render/             the Ebitengine window that draws pkg/city and forwards clicks
pkg/format/             the shared number formatting the table and the cards both use
pkg/claude/             read-only model of ~/.claude (transcripts, sessions, subagents, stats, mcp config)
pkg/state/              the city model: districts, buildings, workers, gauges, derived states
pkg/control/            actions via the claude CLI; terminal spawning
pkg/proto/              socket protocol
pkg/daemon/             watcher + server wiring
pkg/city/               rendering (Ebitengine), layout persistence, input
testing/{integration,acceptance,helpers}/
tools/                  analyze-history.py and the fixture generator
```

Paths follow XDG: config in `~/.config/botropolis`, the saved layout in `~/.local/state/botropolis`,
the socket under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/botropolis`.
Every store finds its state directory through `pkg/statedir`.
A city run with `--headless`, `--record`, `--script` or `--home` works in a temporary one instead,
seeded from a copy of `<home>/.local/state/botropolis` when it was given a home,
and it starts no `claude -p` (item 111).
